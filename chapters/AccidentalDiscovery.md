# The Accidental Discovery

*My story • From chronic pain to consciousness engineering • How a Navy engineer ended up exploring sacred geometry • The framework found me, not the other way around*

---

Let me take you back to one of the worst moments of my life.

I'm standing in front of my couch. Just standing there. You know why? Because I physically cannot sit down. I cannot lie down either. The pain shooting through my back and down my leg is so intense that the only position my body will tolerate is vertical.

So I stand there until I just say I'll deal with the pain.

From the outside, my life looked pretty good. Many years in IT leadership. Navy veteran before that. The guy everyone turned to when things got hard. The problem solver. The go-to person.

But my body was telling a different story.

## The Weight We Carry

I couldn't delegate a task without checking it three times and then fixing it myself. I couldn't say no to anyone without drowning in guilt. I couldn't let go of anything because I believed, deep in my bones, that if I didn't hold everything together, it would all fall apart.

Every night around 3 AM, my eyes would open. My mind would start racing. *What did I miss yesterday? What did my stakeholder think of that proposal? What's waiting for me tomorrow?*

The stress of managing my career and family life had become unbearable. But I kept pushing. I kept grinding. I kept telling myself I just needed to be stronger, work harder, hold on tighter.

Sound familiar?

My body had been keeping score for years. And now the bill came due.

## Missing the Message

Here's the part that makes me shake my head now. Even standing there in agony, unable to sit or lie down, I STILL wasn't getting it. I was still thinking, "I just need to push through this. I just need to find the right doctor. The right procedure. The right pill. "

I'd spent my whole life pushing through. That's what responsible people do, right? That's what leaders do. You don't quit. You don't give up. You definitely don't admit you can't handle it.

Except my body was screaming a different message: "THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER WAY!"

For the first time ever, I actually listened.

## The First Breakthrough

I discovered Dr. John Sarno's work on the mind-body connection. And what I learned changed everything.

My thoughts and repressed emotions were creating my physical symptoms. The pain was real, but the source wasn't a damaged disc or a pinched nerve. The source was decades of suppressed stress, unexpressed emotions, and beliefs I'd been carrying since childhood.

The biggest belief? "I'm only valuable if I'm the one holding it all together."

That belief was literally breaking my body.

Within weeks of understanding this, the pain vanished. Not reduced. Not managed. Gone.

Not through surgery. Not through medication. Through understanding.

I'd spent years and thousands of dollars chasing physical solutions to what was actually an emotional and mental pattern. And the moment I understood the real source, my body let go of the pain it had been using to get my attention.

## Going Deeper

That experience cracked something open in me. It taught me that our thoughts can become something really real in our lives. The pain was real. If my thinking could create that kind of physical pain, what else was it creating? What else could I change by changing how my mind worked?

During the pandemic, I read Grace Smith's book "Close Your Eyes, Get Free." It taught me the foundations of self-hypnosis. This taught me how to access and release stress I'd been carrying for decades. The relief was immediate.

Then I dove into the work of the mindset mentors. Tony Robbins. David Bayer. Michael Singer. David Hawkins. They all said the same thing in different ways:

Your thinking isn't fixed. It's reprogrammable.

The beliefs you formed when you were seven, twelve, fifteen years old? They're still running your life at forty-five. And you can change them.

But here's what really got me. These weren't just feel-good ideas. There was actual structure to how this worked. Patterns. Principles. Almost like... engineering.

I started studying this stuff the way I'd studied engineering concepts and electrical theory. What are the fundamental principles? How does energy actually flow? What's the underlying architecture?

## The Moment That Changed Everything

In 2022, my daughter started suffering from fibromyalgia. She was eighteen years old. Chronic pain. Exhaustion. Doctors couldn't help her.

And here's what broke my heart: I saw the exact same pattern in her that I'd seen in myself.

The perfectionism. The over-responsibility. The belief that she had to carry everything herself. She was eighteen and already becoming a go-to person for everyone around her.

My own pattern had been passed down. And it was destroying her body just like it had destroyed mine.

I had to ask myself the hardest question of my life: "Can I actually guide someone I love through this? Or did I just get lucky with my own healing?"

So I trained. Got certified in hypnotherapy and transformational mindset work. Studied everything I could get my hands on. Not because I wanted to start a business. Because I wanted to help my daughter.

And it worked.

Session by session, I watched her reclaim her life. Her pain decreased. Her energy returned. But more than that, she stopped carrying everyone else's weight. She learned to say no. She learned to let go. She learned that she was valuable just for existing, not just for what she could do for others. She was able to recognize her pain patterns.

## The Gift Hidden in Hell

That's when I realized something profound: My personal hell had become my greatest gift.

All those years of suffering hadn't been wasted. They'd been preparation. I'd been forced to find a way out, and now I could show others the path.

Now I work with founders, executives, and leaders. Smart, successful people who are trapped in the same cycle I was in. The go-to people. The ones who can't delegate. The ones who wake up at 3 AM. The ones whose bodies are keeping score.

## What I Need You to Understand

Your resistance is not your enemy.

Your resistance is not a character flaw.

Your resistance is your subconscious trying to protect you with outdated programming from when you were five, ten, fifteen years old.

Especially if you had to learn to be the responsible one early. Maybe because your parents weren't reliable. Maybe because home wasn't safe. Maybe because you had to hold everything together or everything would fall apart.

That pattern kept you safe then. It helped you survive.

But it's breaking you now.

You're running 2025 software on 1995 hardware, and wondering why you keep crashing.

## How This Framework Found Me

I didn't set out to create a framework for consciousness engineering. I wasn't looking for sacred geometry or quantum field theory. I was just trying to stop hurting.

As I went deeper into my own transformation, and then helped my daughter, and then started working with clients, I kept seeing the same patterns. The same principles. The same geometric structures showing up at every level.

Energy flow. Resistance as the only variable. Natural expansion through breakthrough patterns. The same laws that govern electrical circuits also govern consciousness. The same geometry that creates flowers, grows trees, and keeps flocks of birds together also creates personal evolution.

This framework found me. I stumbled into it backward, following the trail of my own pain until I found the underlying architecture of how transformation actually works.

I'm not someone who meditated in a cave for twenty years. I'm not a mystic who had a spontaneous awakening. I'm an engineer who got broken badly enough that I had to figure out how reality actually operates.

And what I found is this: Transformation follows physics. Consciousness follows geometric patterns. Your resistance isn't blocking your path. It IS the path.

## Why I'm Sharing This

I'm not here because I read a book and thought it sounded interesting.

I'm here because I lived this. Because I found the way out. Because I watched my daughter find the way out. Because I've guided dozens of leaders through the same transformation.

If you are struggling, I can assure you that you were not meant to struggle. The path is clear. The principles are reliable. The transformation is available right now.

But you've got to make a decision.

You've got to stop running the same pattern and expecting different results.

You've got to get honest about what your resistance is really protecting you from.

You've got to recognize that everything you've been doing to try to fix yourself has been focused on the symptoms, not the source.

This book is the map I wish I'd had when I was standing in front of that couch, unable to sit down, wondering if I'd ever feel normal again.

This books is my interpretation of the operating system of transformation, explained in a way that makes sense to me. My hope is it provides the tools you can use immediately.

You don't need to suffer for years like I did.

The way out is simpler than you think.

Let me show you how reality actually works.

*Welcome to the journey. I'm honored to walk this path with you.*
